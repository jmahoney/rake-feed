# The Rake Editorial page, in a feed

This is a quick and dirty scrape of the [Editorial page of TheRake.com](https://therake.com/editorial) converted to the [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) format.

You can subscribe to the feed at http://rake-feed.cheerschopper.com


### Why JSON Feed?
It was the easiest to implement. Ruby and JSON are extremely compatible.
